[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you know
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us
